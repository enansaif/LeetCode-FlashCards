# LeetCode-FlashCards
A Django web app for keeping track of solved questions for easy review.

## How it works
You only need to provide the problem link, a topic to group problems by,

page for each problems by making GraphQL queries to leetcode/graphql server.

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- pip (Python package manager)
- virtualenv
- Git

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/enansaif/flashcards.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

   - **On Windows:**

     ```
     .venv\scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS and Linux:**

     ```
     source .venv/bin/activate
